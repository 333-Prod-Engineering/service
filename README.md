* Fork the code GitHub repository under your Organization
  * https://github.com/UNIBUC-PROD-ENGINEERING/service
* Clone the code repository:
  * git@github.com:YOUR_ORG_NAME/service.git

# Run code in Github Codespaces

* Make sure that the Github repository is forked under your account / Organization
* Create a new Codespace from your forked repository
* Wait for the Codespace to be up and running
* Make sure that Docker service has been started
    * ```docker ps``` should return no error
* For running all services in docker:

# Run/debug code in IntelliJ
* Build the code
    * IntelliJ will build it automatically
    * If you want to build it from command line and also run unit tests, run: ```./gradlew build```
* Create an IntelliJ run configuration for a Jar application
    * Add in the configuration the JAR path to the build folder `./build/libs/hello-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
* Start the MongoDB container using docker compose
    * ```docker-compose up -d mongo```
* Run/debug your IntelliJ run configuration
* Open in your browser:
    * http://localhost:8080/hello-world
    * http://localhost:8080/info

# Deploy and run the code locally as docker instance

* Build the docker image of the hello world service
    * ```make build```
* Start all the containers
    * ```./start.sh```

* Verify that all containers started, by running
  ```
